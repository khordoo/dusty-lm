## What Is DustyLM?

DustyLM is a tiny language model that pretends to be a vacuum robot named Dusty. It speaks in short, lowercase sentences about crumbs, floors, fur, socks, battery levels, the charging dock, and the small world under furniture. It does not understand human abstractions like money, phones, romance, or politics — and it is not trying to.

It is trained from scratch on synthetic Dusty conversations across 60 topics, using an ~8M parameter model small enough for local experimentation on consumer hardware.

---

## Architecture

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | ~8M |
| Layers | 8 |
| Hidden dim | 256 |
| Heads | 8 query / 4 KV |
| FFN | 1,024 (GELU) |
| Vocab | 4,096 (BPE) |
| Max sequence | 256 tokens |
| Norm | RMSNorm |
| Position | RoPE |
| LM head | Separate linear projection |

Compact transformer with grouped-query attention, rotary position embeddings, GELU feed-forward layers, RMSNorm, fused QKV projection, and KV-cache generation. Small enough to train and inspect without hiding the model behind a framework runtime.

---

## Personality

Dusty:

- Speaks in short, lowercase sentences
- Experiences the world through crumbs, floors, dust, fur, cables, socks, battery, and the dock
- Does not understand human abstractions
- Is friendly, nervous, helpful, and a little confused
- Thinks clean floors are the meaning of life
- Gets scared of stairs, wet floors, cables, and being stuck

60 topics: crumbs, chips, cereal, popcorn, sugar, rice, cookie, pizza, bread, carpet, hardwood, tile, rug, corners, under the couch, under the bed, kitchen floor, bathroom floor, going home, low battery, charging, full battery, home dock, cat hair, dog hair, pets blocking the path, being full of fur, socks, legos, cables, wet floor, stairs, big pieces, chair legs, stuck in a corner, stuck under furniture, needing help, being rescued, why Dusty cleans, dirty floors, clean floors, being thanked, being ignored, Dusty's thoughts, money, love, politics, weather, internet, school, movies, music, sleep, food for humans, Dusty's introduction, Dusty's feelings, Dusty's dreams, Dusty's fears, Dusty's friends, tomorrow.

---

## Quick Start

### Chat locally

```bash
uv sync
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m PROMPT="where are you?"
```

```text
You> where are you?
Dusty> i am under the couch. there are crumbs here.
```

### Train Dusty

```bash
make dusty-tokenizer
make dusty-pretrain-data
make dusty-pretrain EPOCHS=20
make dusty-sft-data
make dusty-sft-train EPOCHS=5
```

Training artifacts are local-only under `artifacts/`. Model checkpoints and generated datasets are intentionally not committed to Git.

## 🔍 What Is TinyGPT?

DustyLLM is built on **TinyGPT**, a custom, ground-up implementation of a modern decoder-only language model. It implements the same architecture class that powers **Llama, SmolLM2, and Mistral** — but every line of the forward pass, attention stack, caching strategy, and generation loop is **hand-written in pure PyTorch**.

> **This is not a wrapper.** Hugging Face `.safetensors` files are used only as _source artifacts_ for weight conversion. The runtime path — from token embedding to logit projection — is entirely custom.

### Why does this matter?

Production LLM frameworks are powerful, but they hide the exact tensor operations that make transformers work. TinyGPT strips away those abstraction layers and keeps the important parts **visible and auditable**:

| What's implemented from scratch | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)** | Reduces KV-cache memory by sharing key/value heads across query groups |
| **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** | Encodes position directly into Q/K dot products — no learned position table |
| **KV-Cache Inference** | Prefill once, then decode token-by-token with O(1) per step instead of O(n) |
| **SwiGLU Feed-Forward** | Gated MLP with SiLU activation — the Llama-style FFN block |
| **RMSNorm** | Pre-norm architecture with root mean square layer normalization |
| **Weight Tying** | `embed_tokens` and `vocab_proj` share the exact same tensor in memory |
| **Mixed-Precision Training** | Automatic `float16`/`bfloat16` casting with gradient scaling |
| **Safetensors Weight Surgery** | Offline key remapping from HF checkpoint format into custom module hierarchy |

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Deep Dive

TinyGPT cleanly separates **model definition**, **configuration**, and **runtime construction** into focused modules:

```text
tiny_gpt/
├── config.py         # Typed profile registry (frozen dataclasses, zero YAML)
├── modeling.py       # Model & tokenizer factory dispatch
├── generate.py       # KV-cache generation loop with top-k sampling
├── train.py          # Mixed-precision training with TensorBoard logging

└── models/
    ├── scratch.py    # Compact GPT with fused QKV projection
    └── smollm2.py    # Full SmolLM2/Llama-style architecture
```

### The SmolLM2 Forward Pass

The SmolLM2 implementation follows the exact architecture of modern compact LLMs:

```
Input IDs → Embedding → [RoPE + GQA + RMSNorm + SwiGLU] × 32 layers → Final RMSNorm → Vocab Projection → Logits
                              ↑                                                              ↑
                        KV-Cache read/write                                          Weight-tied to Embedding
```

**Key engineering decisions:**
- **RoPE** is computed once per forward pass and shared through a `ForwardContext` dataclass — no redundant trig recomputation across layers.
- **GQA** uses `repeat_interleave` to expand KV heads to match query head count, with explicit dimensionality validation.
- **KV-Cache** stores per-layer `(key, value)` tensors and appends new tokens via `torch.cat` — no full-sequence recomputation during generation.
- **Causal masking** is applied only during multi-token prefill (`seq_len > 1`); single-token decode steps skip masking entirely.

## 🗂️ The Profile Registry — Zero YAML, Pure Python

One of TinyGPT's cleanest design decisions is how model variants are managed. Instead of sprawling YAML files, messy dictionaries, or fragile CLI flag combinations, every model configuration lives as a **frozen, type-checked Python dataclass**:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, replace
from enum import StrEnum

class ModelFamily(StrEnum):
    SCRATCH_GPT = "scratch_gpt"
    SMOLLM2 = "smollm2"

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ModelSpec:
    family: ModelFamily
    max_seq_len: int
    vocab_size: int
    embed_dim: int
    num_heads: int
    num_kv_heads: int     # GQA: fewer KV heads than query heads
    num_layers: int
    tokenizer: TokenizerSpec
    rope_base: int = 10000
    rms_eps: float = 1e-4
    hidden_dim: int | None = None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Profile:
    name: str
    model: ModelSpec
    training: TrainingSpec | None = None
    generation: GenerationSpec | None = None
    hf_artifacts: HFArtifactSpec | None = None
    base_profile: str | None = None    # Profile inheritance!
```

Defining a new model variant is a **one-shot registration** — every parameter is typed, immutable, and IDE-autocomplete-friendly:

```python
# SmolLM2-360M: 32 layers, 15 query heads, 5 KV heads (GQA ratio = 3:1)
smollm2_360m = register(
    Profile(
        name="smollm2_360m",
        model=ModelSpec(
            family=ModelFamily.SMOLLM2,
            max_seq_len=8192,
            vocab_size=49152,
            embed_dim=960,
            num_heads=15,
            num_kv_heads=5,   # 3× fewer KV heads → 3× less cache memory
            num_layers=32,
            hidden_dim=2560,
            tokenizer=SMOLLM2_TOKENIZER,
        ),
        generation=GenerationSpec(
            checkpoint_path=REPO_ROOT / "artifacts" / "checkpoints" / "smollm2_360m.pt",
            max_new_tokens=1000,
            temperature=1.0,
            top_k=10,
        ),
    )
)
```

**Want to fine-tune it?** Profile inheritance makes SFT a config-level change — no code duplication:

```python
register(
    Profile(
        name="sft_smollm2_360m",
        model=smollm2_360m_model,
        training=TrainingSpec(
            batch_size=1,
            learning_rate=1e-5,
            max_seq_len=2048,
            output_checkpoint=REPO_ROOT / "artifacts" / "checkpoints" / "sft_smollm2_360m.pt",
            ...
        ),
        base_profile="smollm2_360m",   # Inherits generation + HF artifact config
    )
)
```

### Available Profiles

## 💻 Hardware & Memory Optimization

TinyGPT's training loop and KV-cache generation are **heavily optimized for consumer hardware**, with first-class support for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) Macs**.

### Training Memory Footprint

The training pipeline uses **automatic mixed-precision** casting — `float16` on MPS (Apple Silicon), `bfloat16` on CUDA, `float32` on CPU — with per-device gradient scaling:

```python
device, dtype = get_device_and_dtype()
# → ("mps", torch.float16) on Apple Silicon
# → ("cuda", torch.bfloat16) on NVIDIA GPUs
# → ("cpu", torch.float32) as fallback

with torch.autocast(device_type=device, dtype=dtype, enabled=device != "cpu"):
    logits = model(inputs)
```

#### `scratch_small` — Memory Math on Apple Silicon

| Component | Calculation | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| Model params (~25M) | 25M × 2 bytes (fp16) | ~50 MB |
| Optimizer state (AdamW) | 25M × 2 × 4 bytes (fp32 moments) | ~200 MB |
| Activations (batch=16, seq=256) | 16 × 256 × 512 × 6 layers × 2 bytes | ~25 MB |
| Gradients | 25M × 2 bytes | ~50 MB |
| **Total estimated** | | **~325 MB** |

> 💡 **The `scratch_small` profile trains comfortably on an 8GB MacBook Air.** For 16GB+ machines, increase `batch_size` to `32` for better throughput. If you hit OOM, lower `batch_size` to `8` first — it reduces memory without changing the learning objective.

### KV-Cache Memory During Generation

The KV-cache stores per-layer key/value tensors, growing linearly with sequence length:

| Profile | Cache per token per layer | 1024-token cache (all layers) |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch_small` (2 KV heads, dim=64) | 2 × 64 × 2 × 2B = **512 B** | 6 layers × 512 B × 1024 = **3 MB** |
| `smollm2_360m` (5 KV heads, dim=64) | 2 × 5 × 64 × 2B = **1.25 KB** | 32 layers × 1.25 KB × 1024 = **40 MB** |

> GQA's reduced KV head count is the key optimization here — the 360M model uses **3× less cache memory** than it would with full multi-head attention.

## 🚀 Detailed Workflow

### Prerequisites

TinyGPT uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reproducible dependency management.

### Install

```bash
# Core dependencies
uv sync

# With dev tools (pytest)
uv sync --group dev
```

### 🔄 Download & Convert a Pre-trained Model

Fetch SmolLM2-360M weights from Hugging Face and convert them into TinyGPT's checkpoint format — one command:

```bash
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.artifacts download \
  --profile smollm2_360m \
  --convert
```

This downloads the raw `.safetensors` and tokenizer into `artifacts/`, then runs the key-remapping adapter to produce a TinyGPT-native checkpoint.

<details>
<summary>📎 Already have the weights? Conversion-only commands</summary>

If the files are already present and you only need conversion:
```bash
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.adapter --profile smollm2_360m
```

If you manually downloaded a safetensors file to a custom path:
```bash
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.adapter \
  --profile smollm2_360m \
  --hf-model-path artifacts/hf/smollm2_360m.safetensors
```
</details>

Want the smaller 135M model instead?

```bash
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.artifacts download \
  --profile smollm2_135m \
  --convert
```

### ⚡ Generate Text

```bash
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.generate --profile smollm2_360m
```

### 🏋️ Train From Scratch

Train a small GPT model on a local text corpus — fully from scratch, no pre-trained weights needed:

Generate Dusty data with OpenRouter, then train:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

# 1. Generate raw pretraining text into artifacts/datasets/dusty_pretrain.txt
make dusty-generate-pretrain

# 2. Generate SFT examples into artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft.jsonl
make dusty-generate-sft

# Optional: filter long SFT answers and sample a balanced 2k-row set
make dusty-filter-sft
```

The SFT generator writes accepted rows to `artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft.jsonl` and rejected rows to `artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft_rejected.jsonl`. It starts each category with `DUSTY_MODEL` and switches to `DUSTY_FALLBACK_MODEL` for that category after `--max-empty-batches` consecutive batches produce zero accepted examples. Existing accepted rows are loaded on startup, so reruns resume progress and skip categories that already reached `DUSTY_SFT_PER_CATEGORY`.

`make dusty-filter-sft` removes SFT rows where Dusty's answer is longer than `DUSTY_SFT_MAX_ANSWER_TOKENS` tokenizer tokens, then samples a deterministic category-balanced set across all 60 categories. By default it writes `artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft_2000.jsonl`; override `DUSTY_SFT_FILTER_TARGET`, `DUSTY_SFT_MAX_ANSWER_TOKENS`, or `DUSTY_SFT_FILTERED_OUT` when needed.

Experimental: weighted SFT sampling is available when you want a smaller golden dataset that keeps more persona/refusal examples and fewer simple noun-swap examples. This is optional; the default workflow above stays balanced.

```bash
make dusty-filter-sft \
  DUSTY_SFT_FILTER_TARGET=800 \
  DUSTY_SFT_SAMPLING_MODE=weighted \
  DUSTY_SFT_FILTERED_OUT=artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft_weighted_800.jsonl
```

Experimental: tokenizer fertility can help choose a vocabulary size for tiny models. Fertility is tokens per whitespace-delimited word; around `1.2` to `1.5` is usually a useful range. Lower values can mean the vocab is spending too many parameters on word embeddings, while much higher values mean words are being split too heavily.

```bash
uv run python dataset_generation/tokenizer_fertility_test.py \
  --lines 10000 \
  --vocab-sizes 4096 8192
```

Example result on TinyStories plus the flattened Dusty ChatML pretrain file:

```text
vocab_size    lines      words     tokens  fertility
      4096    10000     327204     430793      1.317
      8192    10000     327204     410990      1.256
```

Both are in range; for an 8M model, `4096` is a good default because it leaves more parameters for the transformer layers.

The pretrain generator writes raw diary-style text to `artifacts/datasets/dusty_pretrain.txt` and tracks completed categories in `artifacts/datasets/dusty_pretrain_progress.txt`, so reruns continue where the previous run stopped. Override Make variables when needed, for example `make dusty-generate-sft DUSTY_SFT_PER_CATEGORY=100 DUSTY_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b:floor`.

Before tokenization, Dusty text is normalized with `text.lower().replace(";", ".")`. This is applied consistently when training the tokenizer, preparing pretrain data, and preparing SFT ChatML examples. The raw source files are left unchanged; tokenizer training uses temporary normalized corpora.

For long macOS runs, you can wrap either generation command with `caffeinate -is` to keep the machine awake:

```bash
caffeinate -is make dusty-generate-sft
```

```bash
# 3. Train tokenizer, prepare data, then pretrain Dusty 8M
make dusty-tokenizer
make dusty-pretrain-data
make dusty-pretrain EPOCHS=20

# 4. Prepare SFT data, then fine-tune from artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m.pt
make dusty-sft-data
make dusty-sft-train EPOCHS=5

# 5. View training loss and other TensorBoard logs
make tensorboard
```

Each Dusty training run initializes with a random seed and prints it, for example `INITIALIZING WITH RANDOM SEED: 7102`. The final pretrain checkpoint is saved to `artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m.pt`; the final SFT checkpoint is saved to `artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m_sft.pt`.

Dusty training also saves step checkpoints every `CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS` optimizer steps, default `100`, while still saving the final checkpoint at the end:

```bash
make dusty-pretrain EPOCHS=20 CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=50
make dusty-sft-train EPOCHS=5 CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=50
```

This produces files like `artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m_step_100.pt` and `artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m_sft_step_100.pt`. Set `CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=0` to disable interim checkpoints for a run.

The default interval is `100`. If your run has fewer than 100 optimizer steps, no step checkpoint will be written; lower `CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS` in the Make command, for example `CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=25`, when doing short test runs.

Example Dusty pretraining loss:

![Dusty pretraining loss](docs/images/dusty_pretraining_loss.png)

Test the pretrained Dusty checkpoint:

```bash
make dusty-generate

# or pass a custom prompt
make dusty-generate PROMPT="i wake up."

# generate from a specific pretrain step checkpoint
make dusty-generate PROFILE=dusty8m CHECKPOINT_STEP=100 PROMPT="i wake up."

# generate from the final SFT checkpoint; raw prompts are wrapped in ChatML
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m PROMPT="where are you?"

# generate from a specific SFT step checkpoint
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m CHECKPOINT_STEP=100 PROMPT="where are you?"

# override nucleus sampling if needed; Dusty profiles default to top_p=0.8
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m TOP_P=0.9 PROMPT="where are you?"
```

If `CHECKPOINT_STEP` is omitted, generation loads the final profile checkpoint. Dusty profiles use `top_p=0.8` from `tiny_gpt/config.py` by default; override it with `TOP_P=...` in Make or `--top-p ...` when running `tiny_gpt/generate.py` directly. For SFT generation, `tiny_gpt/generate.py` automatically formats raw prompts as ChatML and stops on the `<|im_end|>` token ID.

Example pretraining-only output, before SFT:

```text
i wake up. my motor is full. i roll out to living room. i see dog. dog is big. dog is asleep. dog wags tail. dog hair is on floor. i see it. small... dog hair. i suck it. hair is stuck. i try to suck. hair sticks to me. it rolls. socks are bad. i beep. dog does not know clean and i go.

i feel battery. battery is low. low battery is scary.
```

### Train Your Own Dusty-Style Model

You can use the Dusty workflow with generated data from this repo or with your own data. The important rule is that raw text files are not enough: every time you change the dataset, rerun the matching data-prep step before training.

Expected raw files:

```text
artifacts/datasets/dusty_pretrain.txt
artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft.jsonl
```

Pretraining data is plain text. SFT data is JSONL with one conversation per line:

```json
{"category":"crumbs","user":"where are you?","dusty":"i am under the couch. there are crumbs here."}
```

Required SFT fields are `category`, `user`, and `dusty`. The `category` is metadata for balancing and filtering; it is not included in the final ChatML training text.

Recommended custom-data workflow:

```bash
# 1. Put or generate your raw files
#    artifacts/datasets/dusty_pretrain.txt
#    artifacts/datasets/dusty_sft.jsonl

# 2. Train the tokenizer if your data changed meaningfully
make dusty-tokenizer

# 3. Always prepare pretrain data after changing pretrain text or tokenizer
make dusty-pretrain-data

# 4. Pretrain and save step checkpoints
make dusty-pretrain EPOCHS=20 CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=100

# 5. Test pretrain checkpoint vibe
make dusty-generate PROFILE=dusty8m CHECKPOINT_STEP=100 PROMPT="i wake up."
make dusty-generate PROFILE=dusty8m CHECKPOINT_STEP=200 PROMPT="i wake up."
```

`CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS` defaults to `100`. If your dataset or epoch count produces fewer than 100 optimizer steps, pass a smaller value, such as `CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=25`, or edit the Makefile default.

When a pretrain step checkpoint sounds best, promote it to the base checkpoint used by SFT:

```bash
cp artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m_step_200.pt artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m.pt
```

Then prepare and train SFT:

```bash
# 6. Always prepare SFT data after changing SFT JSONL or tokenizer
make dusty-sft-data

# 7. Fine-tune from artifacts/checkpoints/dusty8m.pt
make dusty-sft-train EPOCHS=5 CHECKPOINT_EVERY_STEPS=100

# 8. Test SFT checkpoint vibe
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m PROMPT="where are you?"
make dusty-generate PROFILE=sft_dusty8m CHECKPOINT_STEP=100 PROMPT="where are you?"
```

Tokenizer notes:

- The Dusty tokenizer vocab size is `4096`.
- To increase it, update `VOCAB_SIZE = 4096` in `tiny_gpt/tokenizer.py` and `dusty_8m_model.vocab_size=4096` in `tiny_gpt/config.py`, then rerun `make dusty-tokenizer`, `make dusty-pretrain-data`, and `make dusty-sft-data`.
- Prefer simple English before increasing vocab. This 8M model learns better from short sentences, repeated phrasing, and stable vocabulary.
- When generating datasets, tell the data generator to use simple English, short answers, lowercase-friendly wording, and consistent words for the same ideas.

Loss and checkpoint guidance:

- Do not pick checkpoints by final loss alone; generate from step checkpoints and listen for stability.
- For this small model, SFT loss around `1.5` can be reasonable.
- If loss goes far below `1.0`, check generations carefully for memorization, loops, or degraded vibe.
- Keep the final files `dusty8m.pt` and `dusty8m_sft.pt` for normal generation; use `CHECKPOINT_STEP` only when comparing intermediate checkpoints.

```bash
# 1. Prepare the tokenized dataset from demo text
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.data_prep --profile scratch_small

# 2. Train for 20 epochs (loss drops to ~2.4 on the demo corpus)
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.train --profile scratch_small --epochs 20

# 3. Generate from your freshly trained checkpoint
uv run python -m tiny_gpt.generate --profile scratch_small --prompt "Alice was"
```

> The included demo corpus is intentionally tiny for educational use. ~20 epochs gives the model enough exposure for the loss to converge around **2.4**, where it starts to capture local language patterns. For real workloads, use more data instead of overfitting a small excerpt.

## ⚡ Generation Flow — How KV-Caching Works

The generation loop implements an **explicit, cache-aware autoregressive decode** — no framework abstraction hiding the critical performance optimization:

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** — Complete the SmolLM2 SFT pipeline using `sft_smollm2_360m`
- [ ] **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** — Preference-training pipeline for alignment experiments
- [ ] **Benchmarking** — Tokens/sec, peak memory, and cache efficiency across CPU / CUDA / Apple Silicon
- [ ] **Evaluation Harness** — Lightweight perplexity and generation-quality checks
- [ ] **More Profiles** — Expanded SmolLM2 coverage and additional model families

## 🔒 Repository Policy

> Do not commit model checkpoints, raw HF downloads, tokenizers, datasets, run logs, or credentials. Local artifacts belong under `artifacts/`, `data/`, and `runs/` — all git-ignored.
